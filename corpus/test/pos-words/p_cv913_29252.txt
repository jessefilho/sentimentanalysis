pretty
slowly
first
hour
tossing

yet
another
mediocre
outing

many
zingers
delivered
back-and-forth
allen
hunt
actually
interested
resolution

also
appreciated
allen
played
fine
line
homage
films
old
parody
actual
reinvention
note
entire
female
persona
drenched
film
noir
cool
course
films
like

jewish
neurotic
cheating
insecure

decent
plotline
although
expect
real
mystery
anything
solid
acting
around
say
even
remotely
close

work
certainly
believe
step
right
direction
especially
dinky
decade
films
just
went
probably
better
geared
towards

fans
anyone
else
still
recommend
film
anyone
looking
cute
old-school

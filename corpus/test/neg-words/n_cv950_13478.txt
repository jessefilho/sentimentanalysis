follow
several
bunch
moronic

like
liked
direction
except
couple
too-over-the-top
features
like
way-too-glossy
jump

like
oxymoron
obscurities
generally
though
elfont
kaplan
graceful
camera
movement
even
manage
capture
altman-esque
feel
film
time

hokey
really

desintegration
wigger
character
almost
believable
almost
course
lauren
ambrose
wonderful

first
half
belong
film
whenever

automatically
gives
everything
delightfully
satirical
tone
just
cynic
intellectual
just
interesting

provides
entertainment
even
damages
already
damaged

perhaps
one
thing
just
work
jenna

basically
worst
thing
film
real
reason
giving
low
rating
refuses
give
us
fully
realized
characters
insists
follow
around
complete
stereotypes
movies
things
inane
unlike
anything
feel

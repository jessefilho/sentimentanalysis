weak
better
blockbuster
right
now
sleepy
hollow
makes
world
enough
look
like
star
film
anyway
definitely
seem
like
arnold
movie
just
type
film
can
see
sure
gave
us
chuckles
well
known
one-liners
seemed
confused
character
film
going
understandable
especially
ending
changed
according
sources
aside
form
still
walked
much
like
past

spiritual
undoubtedly
ruined
film

hoping
cool
ending
nothing
else
occurred
let
also
know

took
long
cost
much
really
super
affects
unless
consider
invisible
devil
minutes
tops
worth
overpriced
budget
budget

audiences
somewhat
entertained
instead
facing
boredom
pitiful
see
scripts
like
get
bought
made
movie
even
read
things
anymore
sure
seem
like
thankfully
performance
gave
light
poor
film
walks
street
searching
robin
tunney
help
feel
looked
like
devil
guy
creepy
looking
anyway
just
glad

expecting
solid
action

just
another
movie
suckered
